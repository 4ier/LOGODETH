# Contributing to LOGODETH ü§ò

First off, thank you for considering contributing to LOGODETH! It's people like you that make the metal community stronger. 

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## üî• Ways to Contribute

LOGODETH is an open-source project and we love to receive contributions from our community ‚Äî you! There are many ways to contribute:

- **Reporting bugs** üêõ
- **Suggesting enhancements** ‚ú®  
- **Writing code** üíª
- **Improving documentation** üìö
- **Adding logo samples** üñºÔ∏è
- **Testing and feedback** üß™
- **Community engagement** üí¨

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** - Required for backend development
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - For containerized development
- **Git** - Version control
- **Redis** - For caching (can use Docker)
- **OpenAI API Key** - For AI recognition (required for testing)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LOGODETH.git
   cd LOGODETH
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_multimodal.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and settings
   ```

6. **Start Redis** (using Docker):
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
   ```

7. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   # Start API server
   uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   
   # Start frontend (separate terminal)
   cd frontend && python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

## üß™ Testing

We use pytest for testing. Please make sure all tests pass before submitting a PR.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=backend --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_api.py
pytest tests/test_recognition.py
pytest tests/test_cache.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration tests**: Test API endpoints and service interactions
- **Mock external dependencies**: Use mocks for AI APIs in tests
- **Test edge cases**: Invalid inputs, network failures, etc.

Example test:
```python
import pytest
from backend.services.cache import CacheService

def test_image_hashing():
    cache = CacheService()
    image_bytes = b"fake image data"
    
    hash1 = cache.hasher.hash_image(image_bytes)
    hash2 = cache.hasher.hash_image(image_bytes)
    
    assert hash1 == hash2
    assert len(hash1) == 64  # SHA-256 hex length
```

## üìã Code Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications. Use these tools:

```bash
# Format code
black backend/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort backend/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 backend/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy backend/
```

### Code Quality Guidelines

- **Type hints**: Use type hints for all function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Document all public functions and classes
- **Error handling**: Proper exception handling with specific error types
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with appropriate levels
- **Security**: Validate all inputs, sanitize user data

Example function:
```python
async def recognize_logo(
    image_bytes: bytes, 
    provider: str = "openai"
) -> RecognitionResult:
    """
    Recognize a metal band logo using AI vision models.
    
    Args:
        image_bytes: Raw image data
        provider: AI provider to use ('openai' or 'anthropic')
        
    Returns:
        RecognitionResult with band name, confidence, etc.
        
    Raises:
        InvalidImageError: If image format is not supported
        AIServiceError: If AI service is unavailable
    """
    # Implementation here...
```

### Frontend Code Style

- **Modern JavaScript**: Use ES6+ features
- **Consistent formatting**: 2-space indentation
- **Error handling**: Proper try/catch blocks
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and memory

### Git Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```bash
feat: add batch logo processing API
fix: resolve cache key collision issue  
docs: update deployment guide
test: add integration tests for recognition
refactor: simplify AI client architecture
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

```

**Examples:**
- `feat(api): add batch processing endpoint`
- `fix(cache): prevent memory leak in Redis client`
